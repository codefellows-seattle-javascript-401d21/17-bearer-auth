# User Authentication

### Installation and use

when the project is in your working directory, use `npm i` to install any dependencies it needs. Use the URL path `/signup` and input a username, password, and email to create a profile. Then, use the URL path `/signin` and input a username and password using `-a` to authorize the login. Users can create records of their pets, which they can then use CRUD operations on.
